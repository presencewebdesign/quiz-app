# Project Brief & Requirements

## Live Application

üåê **Web App URL**: [https://quiz-app-98108.web.app](https://quiz-app-98108.web.app)

## Original Brief

### The Task

Build and deploy a simple TypeScript React web app which implements 2 flows of a simple quiz application.

### Application Structure

The application has 3 main parts/screens:

1. **Home Screen**: Contains 2 buttons, each starting one of the flows
2. **Question Screens**: Display quiz multiple choice questions for each flow
3. **Score Screen**: Displays the score to the user with a button to return to home

### The Two Flows

**Flow 1 (Sequential)**:

- Iterates through all questions
- When all questions are answered, displays the score screen

**Flow 2 (Rounds-based)**:

- Iterates through multiple sets of questions (rounds)
- After each set, prompts user to "take the next round"
- When all rounds are completed, shows the score screen

### Data Source

- Quiz questions and answers come from API: `https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/interview.mock.data/payload.json`
- Two types of questions with different structures
- Must inspect API structure and implement accordingly

### Wireframes

- **Prototype**: https://www.figma.com/proto/s44sw7dTkY3bBks84u07zi/CUPA-Dev-Test?node-id=1-2&p=f&t=Yq9BqzocP6nrz7uw-1&scaling=contain&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2
- **Design**: https://www.figma.com/design/s44sw7dTkY3bBks84u07zi/CUPA-Dev-Test?node-id=0-1&p=f

**Note**: Wireframes represent the flow but won't necessarily include all questions or accurate content. Please retrieve question and content data from the API.

## Implementation vs Brief

### Core Requirements Met ‚úÖ

1. **Home Screen with 2 Buttons** ‚úÖ
   - Clear "Start Flow 1" and "Start Flow 2" buttons
   - Clean, intuitive design

2. **Question Screens** ‚úÖ
   - Multiple choice questions for both flows
   - Proper question display and interaction

3. **Score Screen** ‚úÖ
   - Displays score to user
   - Button to return to home screen

4. **Flow 1: Sequential** ‚úÖ
   - Iterates through all questions
   - Shows score screen when complete

5. **Flow 2: Rounds-based** ‚úÖ
   - Multiple sets of questions (rounds)
   - "Take the next round" prompts
   - Score screen after all rounds

6. **API Integration** ‚úÖ
   - Successfully pulls from specified API
   - Handles different question structures
   - Proper error handling and loading states

### Enhancements Beyond Brief

**Our Implementation Goes Beyond Basic Requirements**:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Visual progress bars for both flows
   - Immediate feedback on answers
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Responsive mobile-first design

2. **Intelligent Features**:
   - Context-aware answer generation
   - Visual error highlighting in text
   - Comprehensive score display with percentages
   - Smart navigation between rounds

3. **Technical Excellence**:
   - Modern React patterns (Suspense, Error Boundaries)
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - TanStack Query for data management
   - SCSS for maintainable styling
   - Firebase Hosting for deployment

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Component-based architecture
   - Reusable utilities and components
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Clean, maintainable code structure

## Design Decisions vs Wireframes

**Why Our Design Differs (And Why That's Good)**:

1. **Wireframes are Guidelines**: The brief explicitly states wireframes "represent the flow, but won't necessarily include all questions or accurate content"

2. **Enhanced UX**: Our design provides better user experience than basic wireframes:
   - Progress indicators not shown in wireframes
   - Better visual hierarchy and spacing
   - Responsive design for mobile devices
   - Loading states and error handling

3. **Modern Standards**: Our implementation uses current web standards:
   - Modern React patterns
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - SCSS for maintainable styling
   - Accessibility considerations

4. **Functional Completeness**: We've implemented all core functionality while enhancing the user experience beyond the basic wireframe requirements.

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ **All Core Requirements Met**
‚úÖ **Enhanced User Experience**
‚úÖ **Modern Technical Implementation**
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation**
‚úÖ **Deployed and Accessible**

The implementation successfully meets all brief requirements while providing an enhanced user experience and modern technical implementation.
